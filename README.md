# 📦 E-commerce-Return-Rate-Reduction-Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
This project analyzes and visualizes e-commerce order and return data to:
- Understand return patterns across products, countries, and time periods
- Identify high-risk products with high return probabilities
- Support decision-making to reduce return rates

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**
- Dataset: `ecommerce_return_predictions.csv` using https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nacNzd0nyub4uafswtLLMxSc7dcyD3vm?usp=drive_link

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The interactive dashboard includes:

1. **Line Chart**
   - Monthly trends of returns over time.

2. **Bar Chart**
   - Number of returns by country.

3. **Donut Chart**
   - Distribution of return probability segments (Low, Medium, High).
